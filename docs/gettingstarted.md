# Getting started

FFscala is a wrapper library for the FFmpeg command line. Most functions return command line arguments for FFmpeg, and by composing them you can make use of FFmpeg in your software. Some functionality requires more function composition than others.

Some functions execute FFmpeg for specific functionality, like ```execute()``` for encoding media files, or ```record()``` for capturing your desktop or audio devices.

This documentation file is unfinished so I didn't make a link to it yet.
